# COSC1114-A1
Operating Systems Principles (COSC1114) - Programming Assignment 1 

##Instructions to run:
Run 
scl enable devtoolset-9 bash or
scl enable devtoolset-9 zsh 
or command appropriate to shell being used as the programs will not compile without enabling this.

To run Problem A (Producer Consumer) solution:
make prodCons
./prodCons
**Recommendation**
I would recommend writing output for this program to a file as there are millions of lines of output (ie ./prodCons > a.txt)

To run Problem D (Sleeping Barbers) solution:
make barbers
./barbers
